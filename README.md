# Cooling-The-Cloud

The Goal:
To minimize the total daily operating cost of a Phoenix-based Data Center by optimizing when they consume power and how they cool their servers.
How it works:
Our model analyzes hourly Grid Demand (from EIA data) and Outside Temperature (from NOAA data) to make two decisions for every hour of the day:
Load Shifting: Move flexible computer processing tasks to times when electricity is cheaper.
Cooling Switching: Switch between Water-based cooling (efficient but uses scarce water) and Electric Chillers (uses no water but high energy) based on the outside heat.
The Result:
A schedule that reduces strain on the Arizona power grid during peak hours and conserves water during the hottest parts of the day.


Here is the continuation of the strategy, including the specific data set links and how to structure the optimization model to win the "Creativity" and "Model Difficulty" points.
The Idea: "Cooling the Cloud" (Data Center Load & Cooling Optimization)
The Concept:
Arizona is a major hub for Data Centers (due to cheap power and lack of natural disasters), but they face two huge problems:
Peak Energy Costs: Electricity is expensive during late afternoon "super peak" hours.
Water Usage vs. Cooling: Data centers use massive amounts of water for evaporative cooling. Using water saves electricity, but water is scarce. Using traditional air conditioning (chillers) saves water, but spikes electricity usage.
The Optimization Goal:
Minimize the combined cost of Electricity + Water for a theoretical 50MW Data Center in Phoenix over a 24-hour period.
Decision Variable 1 (Load Shifting): When do we run "batch processing" jobs? (Move them away from 5 PM peak).
Decision Variable 2 (Cooling Mode): At hour

, do we use Water Cooling (high water use, low energy) or Chiller Cooling (zero water use, high energy)? This depends on the outside air temperature.
The Two Public Data Sets (Links)
1. Electricity Demand & Pricing Data (The "Grid" Component)
Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Hourly Grid Monitor.
What to get: You want the hourly demand and interchange for the Southwest (SW) region. Since Arizona is not in a unified ISO like PJM, the EIA data for the Southwest region is the most standard "public" set for AZ grid load.
Link: EIA Hourly Electric Grid Monitor
Instructions: Go to "Region," select "Southwest (SW)." Download the csv for the last available 24-hour period (or a hot day in July for better results). Use the "Demand" column as a proxy for electricity price (or map it: High Demand = High Price).
2. Weather Data (The "Physical" Component)
Source: NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.
What to get: Hourly dry bulb temperature for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. This is critical because cooling efficiency changes based on how hot it is outside.
Link: NOAA Climate Data Online
Instructions: Select "Daily Summaries" or "LCD (Local Climatological Data)." Search "Phoenix, AZ." Download the CSV. You need the HOURLYDRYBULBTEMPF column.
The Optimization Model (How to Build It)
Since the prompt suggests Python (Pyomo/GEKKO) or AMPL, here is the mathematical formulation you can code.

Why This Wins
No Solar: You avoided the obvious choice.
"Arizona" Specific: It tackles the two biggest headlines in AZ: The tech boom (Data Centers) vs. Resource Scarcity (Water/Grid).
Complexity: You aren't just optimizing

; you are optimizing a system that reacts to temperature. The judges will love that you used weather data to drive an energy decision.
Visuals: You can plot a graph showing how your model "switches" cooling modes exactly when the temperature drops at night, saving money.
